### Objective
* To perform exploratory data analysis using Python - Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
* Analyse the data and present key insights on freight cost based on the country, and manufacturing site.

### Data Cleaning and Manipulation

* Data cleaning and manipulation were done on **7000+** records of data.
* Dropped **Item Description** and **Molecule/Test Type** columns as they were not necessary for the analysis. 
* Other columns could have also been dropped so that the dataset size will be reduced and it will be easier for processing.
* Filtered rows from **Weight (Kilograms)** and **Freight Cost (USD)** columns which had object datatype.
* Changed datatypes of **Weight (Kilograms)**, **Freight Cost (USD)**, **Scheduled Delivery Date**, **Delivered to Client Date** and **Delivery Recorded Date** columns.
* Analysis and visualization were executed to present key insights on freight cost based on the country, shipment mode and manufacturing site.
